367	s226	"that membrane-associated C1199 Tiam1 , but not cytoplasmic C580 Tiam1 , induces ruffling and activates JNK would be that GDP-bound Rac is partly present at the plasma membrane in NIH3T3 and COS-7 cells ."	[]		p41	Discussion	FALSE	implication	37648	37848	
368	s227	"The activation of this pool of membranebound , inactive Rac by Tiam1 is then sufficient for the induction of membrane ruffles and activation of JNK ."	[]		p41	Discussion	FALSE	implication	37849	37996	
369	s228	Alternative explanations would be	[]		p41	Discussion	FALSE	hypothesis	37997	38030	
370	s228	"that the activity of Tiam1 is enhanced at the plasma membrane , or that Tiam1 is also involved in the translocation of Rac from the cytoplasm to the plasma membrane ."	[]		p41	Discussion	FALSE	hypothesis	38031	38195	
371	s229	"In all these models , the controlled membrane association of Tiam1 is the only determinant for the induction of membrane ruffling by Rac ."	[]		p41	Discussion	FALSE	implication	38196	38332	
372	s230	"Since MSC580 Tiam1 , but not C580 Tiam1 , induces membrane ruffling , it is unlikely"	[]		p41	Discussion	FALSE	fact	38333	38414	
373	s230	that the activation of cytoplasmic Rac by Tiam1 leads to the membrane translocation of GTPbound Rac .	[]		p41	Discussion	FALSE	hypothesis	38415	38515	
374	s231	"As discussed before , however"	[]		p41	Discussion	FALSE	hypothesis	38516	38544

376	s232	Further exploration of these models will require the generation of antibodies	[]		p41	Discussion	FALSE	goal	38652	38729	
377	s232	that efficiently detect endogenous Tiam1 and Rac and tools to discriminate between active and inactive endogenous Rac .	[]		p41	Discussion	FALSE	goal	38730	38848	
378	s233	"Given the importance of PH domains in Tiam1 and other GDS proteins , it is conceivable"	[]		p42	Discussion	FALSE	hypothesis	38849	38934
